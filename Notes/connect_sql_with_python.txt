What is SQL?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage relational databases. It allows you to create, modify, and query databases.

Basic syntax:

SELECT: retrieves data from one or more tables
FROM: specifies the table(s) to retrieve data from
WHERE: filters the data based on a condition
ORDER BY: sorts the data in ascending or descending order
GROUP BY: groups the data based on one or more columns
JOIN: combines data from multiple tables based on a related column
Data types:
CHAR and VARCHAR: store character strings
INT: stores integers
FLOAT and DOUBLE: store floating-point numbers
DATE and TIME: store dates and times
BOOLEAN: stores true/false values
Basic queries:
SELECT * FROM table_name: retrieves all columns from a table
SELECT column_name FROM table_name: retrieves specific columns from a table
SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition: filters data based on a condition
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name: returns the number of rows in a table
SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name: returns unique values in a column
SELECT column_name FROM table_name ORDER BY column_name ASC/DESC: sorts data in ascending or descending order
Advanced queries:
INNER JOIN: returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables
OUTER JOIN: returns all rows from both tables, and where there is no match in one of the tables, returns NULL values
SUBQUERY: a query within a query, used to filter data based on the results of another query
UNION: combines the results of two or more SELECT statements


To connect SQL with Python, you can use a Python library such as pyodbc, pymysql, or sqlite3. Here are the general steps:

Install the appropriate library for your SQL database. For example, if you are using MySQL, you can install pymysql using pip:

Copy code
pip install pymysql
Import the library in your Python script:

python
Copy code
import pymysql
Establish a connection to your SQL database using the connect() method:

sql
Copy code
connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='username',
    password='password',
    db='database_name'
)
Replace localhost, username, password, and database_name with the appropriate values for your database.

Create a cursor object using the cursor() method:


cursor = connection.cursor()
Execute SQL commands using the execute() method on the cursor object:


cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM table_name')
Retrieve the results using methods like fetchall() or fetchone():


results = cursor.fetchall()
Close the cursor and connection:


cursor.close()
connection.close()
Here's a complete example for connecting to a MySQL database and retrieving data:


import pymysql

connection = pymysql.connect(
    host='localhost',
    user='username',
    password='password',
    db='database_name'
)

cursor = connection.cursor()

cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM table_name')
results = cursor.fetchall()

for row in results:
    print(row)

cursor.close()
connection.close()
